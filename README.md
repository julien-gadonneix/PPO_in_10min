# PPO_in_10min

## PPO code - All you need to know (80/20 rule applied)

### Bioengineering applications at stake !

[Acknowledgement: the code is fully inspired from `[this code](https://github.com/labmlai/annotated_deep_learning_paper_implementations/tree/master/labml_nn/rl/ppo)`]

No lengthy and boring introduction, I'm going straight to the point:

My goal: Give you the keys to fully understand, reexplain and build a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) method: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO);

My time limit: Only 10 minutes;

My tools: Python coding and Mathematical theory explanation;

Your takeaway: Improved knowledge on state-of-the-art RL techniques and world-wide recognised skills on machine and deep learning applied to PPO;

Bonus: An application to bioengineering (let's enjoy a bit what we did…);
