# PPO_in_10min

## PPO code - All you need to know (80/20 rule applied)

### Bioengineering applications at stake !

[Acknowledgements: I'm not almighty and I need your help. Comment any suggestions or improvements ;)]

No lengthy and boring introduction, I'm going straight to the point:
My goal: Give you the keys to fully understand, reexplain and build a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) method: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO);
My time limit: Only 10 minutes;
My tools: Python coding and Mathematical theory explanation;
Your takeaway: Improved knowledge on state-of-the-art RL techniques and world-wide recognised skills on machine and deep learning applied to PPO;
Bonus: An application to bioengineering (let's enjoy a bit what we did…);
Results:
{results: "Success"}
Get ready to be a better person !
