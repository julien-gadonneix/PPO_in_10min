# PPO_in_10min

## PPO code - All you need to know (80/20 rule applied)

### Bioengineering applications at stake !

[Acknowledgement: the code is inspired from [this code](https://github.com/labmlai/annotated_deep_learning_paper_implementations/tree/master/labml_nn/rl/ppo)]

I'm going straight to the point:

My goal: Provide you with the keys to fully understand, explain, and implement a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) method: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO);

My time limit: 10 minutes;

My tools: Python coding using PyTorch and Mathematical theory explanations;

Your takeaway: Enhanced understanding of RL techniques and globally recognised skills in artificial intelligence, specifically applied to PPO;

Bonus: A bioengineering application (let’s appreciate what we’ve accomplished!);
